My name is Tobias Roeser.

I'm a software developer living in Leipzig, Germany. I'm a Scala and OSGi Enthusiast and love Open-Source development.

On this blog you will find various notes mostly about programming but sometimes also other stuff. I don't blog on a regular basis though.

You can find me also on Twitter as @TobiasRoeser and GitHub as lefou.
