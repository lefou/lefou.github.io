My name is Tobias Roeser.

I'm a software developer living in Lusatia, an region in the east of Germany. I'm a Scala and OSGi Enthusiast and love Open-Source development.

On this blog you will find various notes mostly about programming but sometimes also other stuff. I don't blog on a regular basis.

You can find me also on Twitter as https://twitter.com/TobiasRoeser[@TobiasRoeser] and GitHub as https://github.com/lefou[lefou].
