It's time to start a new blog.

Not that I have to say that much currently, but at least to preserve some posts of the old died server and to have a place for future content.

This new blog is hosted on Github and build with JBake, AsciiDoctor and SBuild (via the JBake Plugin).

Happy new year 2015!

Tobias
